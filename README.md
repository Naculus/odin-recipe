# odin-recipe

This is my first TOP recipe

I've created a repository on github
Used my terminal to mkdir repos
cd repos/ 
to clone this what I did git clone git@github.com:Naculus/odin-recipe.git this is my ssh code

In the terminal cd into the project folder and added readme with git add
then push it into your repository with git push origin main
